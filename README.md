# Kafkaesque

This is like Kafka but different (clever, right?). This is my attempt at implementing a simpler version of Apache Kafka (a distributed pull-based event queue) with the goal of gaining a better understanding of Go.

The hope is this will eventually be a project that can actually be used by others, but for right now it is a log of my learning.
